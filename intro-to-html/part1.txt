The tags explain to your computer what it has to show on the screen.
<> like -> <tag>

-> text nature=> this is the title, an image, a paragraph,.... of our page
2types of tags:
. Pairs tags    
        Need and open tag and ending tag: <title> This is a tilte</title>

        Indicate to the computer that everything which is not between these 2 tags is not a title

        -> This is not a title <title> This is a title </title> This is not a title
.Orphan tags
        Used for insertion of elements at the precise place 
        (for example a picture - <picture/>)
        There is no need to open a tag and placing an end tag, we just want to say to the computer "add a picture here"

        The/is optional but it's recommended to had since it as a good practice between developers.


Attributes
-----------
Use in order to add options and provide more informations about the tag.
Always placed after the nae of the open tag. Most of the time has a value.

    <tag attribute="value">

    </quote>


Basic Structure of HTML
-----------------------

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang='en' dir='ltr'>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title> </title>
    </head>
    <body>


    </body>
</html>

The DOCTYPE is retained in HTML5 as a mostly, useless, but required header
only to trigger "standards mode" in common browers.

<html> tag is the first tag that we have to open and the last one to close.
<head> for develop, user can't see this data. head tag use only for information 
<title> always required. should identify the contents of the document in a global context, 
        and may be used in a history lists and as a label for window displaying the document. 
        The TITLE element must occur within the head of the document, and may not contain anchors, 
        paragraph tags, or highlighting. There is only one TITLE tag.

        The length of the title is unlimited, however, long title may be truncated in some
        applicatoins, To minimize this possibility, keep titles to fewer than 64 characters.


        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang='en' dir='ltr'>
            <head>
                <meta charset="utf-8">
                <title> The title goes here </title>
            </head>
            <body>


            </body>
        </html>

<meta> =>   Meta information can be extracted by servers/clients for use in identifying, 
            indexing and cataloging specialized document meta-information.

            The META element attribute:

            charset
            -------
                You need to specify the encode of your page with: 
                <meta charset="utf-8"/> -- indicate the way your file gonna be saved.

                Example with it:

                <!DOCTYPE html>
                <html lang='en' dir='ltr'>
                    <head>
                        <meta charset="utf-8">
                        <title> </title>
                    </head>
                    <body>
                        iHola!
                        Bonjour!

                </html>


HTML tags
==========
<body> ... </body>
This is where you will write all of your HTML code. The document body is composed
from zero or more of the following elements:

        => DIV --- used for hierarchical containers and static banners.
        => Headings ( H1 to H6) --- a set of headers of varying levels of importance
        => Block elements --- paragraph, lists, forms, tables, figures and other elements
        => Horizontal rules, and the ADDRESS element
        => Text and character level markup including emphasis, images, math, hypertext links
            and miscellaneous elements.

    <p> ... </p>    Used to create paragraphs
    <br/>   As you saw with <p> if you just want go to the next line without the creation of
            a new paragraph, then you have to use <br/> . 
            <br/> has to be in a paragraph section.

            If you want to do multiple jump to the line then is better to use CSS.
